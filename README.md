# gridset
Downloaded sets from the now defunct Gridset app

The Gridset app—originally developed by Mark Boulton Design before its aquisition by Monotype—has been one of my favourite tools for designing grids.

Sadly, Gridset is being decommisioned at the end of July 2018, so this repo contains my backup of the Gridset default sets, plus a few of my favourite grids used for client projects.

The Archive Set folder contains some of the grids I’ve been using recently to develop designs for my book, Art Direction for the Web.

I’m sad to see Gridset go, and hope you find these archives helpful.

Love
